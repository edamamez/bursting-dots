# bursting-dots
Written in 2016
Java was the first computer language I learned and this is the first full project I made using it! 
Based off of a mobile game (I unfortunately forget the name of, please let me know if you know it
so I can give proper credits)

To run (easiest way): 
Import into Eclipse and run the GameGraphics.java file

To play: 
Click anywhere on the board to explode a dot and start a chain reaction. Any dots that
hit a bursting dot will also explode, try to explode enough to reach the goal!

To edit the game:
In GameGraphics.java, you can change the number of dots on the board and target number of dots to burst by changing
the 'dotsAdd' and 'goal' variables in the constructor. (I may edit this to make it easier to change the
size with a global variable...)
